# BISO Program Maturity Model

**Purpose:** Guide BISO program growth from quick start to industry excellence
**Philosophy:** Start simple, scale with success, add complexity as organizational maturity increases
**Based on:** FS-ISAC whitepaper guidance - "begin with a subset of business lines and use outcomes to improve"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Starting at Level 3
**Problem:** New programs trying to implement comprehensive framework immediately
**Result:** Overwhelm, paralysis, delayed value delivery
**Solution:** Start at Level 1, prove value, then scale

### ❌ Staying at Level 1 Too Long
**Problem:** Successful programs not maturing processes
**Result:** Manual inefficiency, burnout, inability to scale
**Solution:** Advance when success criteria met

### ❌ Skipping Levels
**Problem:** Jumping from Level 1 → Level 3
**Result:** Missing foundational capabilities, process gaps
**Solution:** Progress through each level systematically

### ❌ Wrong Metrics for Level
**Problem:** Level 1 programs focused on ROI instead of trust
**Result:** Wrong success criteria, missed relationship building
**Solution:** Match metrics to maturity level

---

## How to Use This Model

### For New Programs
1. Start at Level 1 (read /core/, use 3 templates)
2. Focus on relationships (Trust Equation primary metric)
3. Build trust for 3-6 months
4. Advance when stakeholders demand expansion

### For Existing Programs
1. Assess current maturity level honestly
2. Identify gaps in current vs. target level
3. Fill gaps systematically (don't skip levels)
4. Advance when success criteria consistently met

### For Scaling Programs
1. Use maturity model to plan growth
2. Add resources (templates, advanced docs) as needed
3. Mature processes before adding automation
4. Celebrate level advancement milestones
