## Implementation Guide

### Month 1: Set Up Your Survey

**Choose Your Method:**
- ✅ **Email (simplest):** Just send personalized emails monthly
- ✅ **Survey tool (scalable):** Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, Typeform
- ✅ **Slack/Teams (digital orgs):** Native reactions + comments
- ✅ **Hybrid:** Email link to web form

**Set Up Tracking Spreadsheet:**
```
File: BISO_Monthly_Pulse_Tracking.xlsx or .csv

| Month | Stakeholder | Business Unit | Score (1-5) | Comment | Follow-Up Needed |
|-------|-------------|---------------|-------------|---------|------------------|
| Jan   | VP Retail   | Retail        | 4           | None    | No               |
| Jan   | CFO         | Finance       | 3           | "Slow response times" | Yes - schedule call |
```

### Month 2+: Build Your Rhythm

**Timing:** Send survey on the same day each month (e.g., first Monday)

**Monthly Process:**
1. **Day 1 (10 min):** Send surveys to all Tier 1 & 2 stakeholders
2. **Day 3 (5 min):** Send reminder to non-responders
3. **Day 5 (15 min):** Close survey, analyze results
4. **Day 6 (30 min):** Follow up on any red flags (scores <3)
5. **Day 7 (10 min):** Update tracking spreadsheet

**Total time investment:** ~70 minutes/month

---

## Response Rate Strategies

### Get >70% Response Rate:

✅ **Keep it short:** 1 question = 2 minutes max
✅ **Personalize:** Use stakeholder names, not generic "Dear User"
✅ **Timing:** Avoid Monday AM, Friday PM, month-end
✅ **Mobile-friendly:** Test on phone before sending
✅ **Show appreciation:** Thank responders, show you act on feedback
✅ **Close the loop:** Share what you changed based on feedback

❌ **Don't do this:**
- Don't send long surveys (kills response rates)
- Don't make it anonymous IF you need to follow up (defeats purpose)
- Don't send surveys too frequently (survey fatigue)
- Don't ignore feedback (destroys trust)

### Segment Your Audience:

**Tier 1 Stakeholders** (High Power, High Interest):
- Survey monthly
- Always follow up on <4 scores
- Personal thank you for responses

**Tier 2 Stakeholders** (Keep Informed):
- Survey monthly
- Follow up on <3 scores
- Automated thank you OK

**Tier 3 Stakeholders** (Monitor):
- Survey quarterly
- Follow up only on <2 scores

---

## Analyzing Results

### Monthly Analysis (15 minutes)

**1. Calculate Average Score**
```
Total Scores: 4 + 5 + 3 + 4 + 4 = 20
Number of Responses: 5
Average: 20 ÷ 5 = 4.0
```

**2. Identify Red Flags**
Any score <3 = Immediate follow-up required

**3. Track Trends**
```
Monthly Trend Chart:

5.0 |              ●
4.5 |         ●
4.0 |    ●
3.5 | ●
3.0 |________________________
    Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr  May

Trend: Improving (good!)
```

**4. Review Comments**
Look for themes:
- Multiple mentions of same issue = systemic problem
- Positive reinforcement = keep doing this
- Specific requests = actionable improvements

### Quarterly Deep Dive (30 minutes)

**Review 3-month trends:**
- Which stakeholders consistently score low?
- Which business units are happiest/unhappiest?
- Are things improving or declining?
- What comments are recurring?

**Create action plan:**
| Issue Identified | Stakeholders Affected | Action | Owner | Due Date |
|------------------|----------------------|--------|-------|----------|
| Slow response times | 3 BUs | Implement 4-hour SLA | BISO | Next month |
| Not involved early | 2 BUs | Attend BU planning meetings | BISO | Ongoing |

---

## Interpreting Scores

### 🟢 Average >4.0: Excellent Partnership
**What this means:** Stakeholders are highly satisfied with your support.

**What to do:**
- Maintain current approach
- Ask: "What should we keep doing?"
- Share success with CISO and team
- Use as reference for other BISOs

### 🟡 Average 3.0-4.0: Good, Room for Improvement
**What this means:** Partnership is working, but not exceptional.

**What to do:**
- Review comments for improvement opportunities
- Follow up with lower-scoring stakeholders
- Ask: "What would make this a 5?"
- Address systemic issues (appears in multiple comments)

### 🔴 Average <3.0: Partnership Problems
**What this means:** Stakeholders are neutral to dissatisfied. Immediate action required.

**What to do:**
1. **This week:** Identify root cause (review all comments)
2. **Schedule calls:** 1-on-1s with lowest-scoring stakeholders
3. **Ask directly:** "What's not working? What should I change?"
4. **Create recovery plan:** Specific actions, specific timelines
5. **Check in weekly:** Don't wait for next month's survey
6. **Escalate if needed:** Engage CISO for support

## Best Practices

### Do This:
✅ Send surveys same day each month (build routine)
✅ Keep surveys short (1 question + optional comment)
✅ Follow up on low scores within 24 hours
✅ Close the loop (tell stakeholders what you changed)
✅ Track trends over time (more important than single-month scores)
✅ Celebrate improvements (share wins with CISO)

### Don't Do This:
❌ Skip months (breaks rhythm, loses trust)
❌ Make surveys too long (kills response rates)
❌ Ignore negative feedback (destroys credibility)
❌ Get defensive about criticism (misses opportunity to improve)
❌ Only survey when things are good (defeats early warning purpose)
❌ Make it anonymous if you need to follow up (can't address specific issues)

## Common Questions

**Q: Should surveys be anonymous?**
A: No, if you want to follow up on issues. Anonymous surveys don't let you help specific stakeholders. Promise confidentiality instead: "Your individual responses won't be shared, but I will follow up personally to address concerns."

**Q: What if response rates are low?**
A:
1. Shorten the survey (1 question only)
2. Personalize the ask
3. Show how you've acted on previous feedback
4. Try different channels (email vs. Slack)
5. Make it mobile-friendly

**Q: What if scores drop suddenly?**
A: This is the early warning system working!
1. Investigate immediately
2. Check for recent incidents or changes
3. Follow up with stakeholders who scored low
4. Address systemic issues quickly
5. Resurvey in 2-3 weeks to verify improvement

**Q: How do I handle negative comments?**
A: As gifts! Negative feedback is more valuable than positive feedback for improvement. Thank them for honesty, follow up quickly, and show you took action.
