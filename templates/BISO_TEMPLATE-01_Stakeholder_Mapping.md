# BISO Stakeholder Mapping Template

**Purpose:** Identify and prioritize key stakeholders for targeted BISO engagement
**Usage:** Complete quarterly (Month 1, 4, 7, 10) or when stakeholder landscape changes
**Time Required:** 30-45 minutes initial mapping, 15-20 minutes quarterly updates

---

## What is Stakeholder Mapping?

The **Power-Interest Matrix** helps BISOs prioritize engagement by plotting stakeholders on two dimensions:
- **POWER**: Ability to influence BISO program decisions and resources
- **INTEREST**: Level of concern/involvement in BISO activities and outcomes

This creates four stakeholder categories with distinct engagement strategies.

## How to Complete This Template

### Step 1: List Your Stakeholders (5-10 minutes)

Write down everyone who impacts or is impacted by your BISO program:

**Executive Leadership:**
- [ ] CEO
- [ ] CISO
- [ ] CFO
- [ ] CRO (Chief Risk Officer)
- [ ] COO
- [ ] Business Unit Presidents

**Business Unit Leaders:**
- [ ] VPs of major business units

- [ ] IT Directors
- [ ] Solution Architects
- [ ] DevOps Teams

**External:**
- [ ] Regulators
- [ ] External Auditors
- [ ] Key Vendors
- [ ] Partners

### Step 2: Assess POWER (5-10 minutes)

For each stakeholder, ask:

**HIGH POWER = YES to 2+ questions:**
- [ ] Can they approve/deny BISO budget or resources?
- [ ] Can they influence executive perception of BISO program?
- [ ] Do they control access to business units or data?
- [ ] Can they escalate issues that impact BISO effectiveness?

**LOW POWER = NO to most questions**

### Step 3: Assess INTEREST (5-10 minutes)

For each stakeholder, ask:

**HIGH INTEREST = YES to 2+ questions:**
- [ ] Are they directly impacted by BISO decisions/activities?
- [ ] Do they frequently request BISO support or consultation?
- [ ] Are they vocal about security or BISO program topics?
- [ ] Do they proactively engage with BISO team?

**LOW INTEREST = NO to most questions**

### Step 4: Plot on Matrix (5-10 minutes)

Place each stakeholder in appropriate quadrant based on Power + Interest assessment.

### Step 5: Define Engagement Strategy (10-15 minutes)

Use the **Engagement Strategy Guide** below to plan touchpoints for each stakeholder.

---

## Engagement Strategy Guide by Quadrant

### 🔴 MANAGE CLOSELY (High Power, High Interest)
**Who:** CEO, CISO, CRO, Business Unit Presidents actively engaged

**Strategy:**
- Weekly touchpoints (meetings, status updates, consultations)
- Involve in major decisions early
- Seek input and feedback regularly
- Build deep trust relationships (use Trust Equation scorecard)
- Make them BISO program champions

**Risk if ignored:** Program failure, lost support, resource cuts

---

### 🟡 KEEP SATISFIED (High Power, Low Interest)
**Who:** CFO, COO, Board members, Legal (unless compliance-heavy org)

**Strategy:**
- Monthly executive summaries
- Quarterly business reviews
- Keep informed of major milestones/issues
- Don't overwhelm with details
- Surface for critical decisions only

**Risk if ignored:** Surprise objections, budget challenges, blocked decisions

---

### 🟢 KEEP INFORMED (Low Power, High Interest)
**Who:** Security teams, IT managers, product managers, enthusiastic champions

**Strategy:**
- Bi-weekly or monthly updates
- Include in relevant meetings/working groups
- Use as BISO advocates and informal communication channel
- Provide detailed information (they want it)
- Leverage their enthusiasm

**Risk if ignored:** Loss of allies, misinformation spread, missed opportunities

---

### ⚪ MONITOR (Low Power, Low Interest)
**Who:** External vendors (some), peripheral functions, occasional contacts

**Strategy:**
- Quarterly updates or as-needed basis
- Minimal active engagement
- Watch for changes in power or interest
- Basic awareness communications only

**Risk if ignored:** Minimal (but monitor for changes)

---

## Stakeholder Relationship Tracking Table

| [Name] | [Title] | KEEP INFORMED | Security collaboration | Bi-weekly | 🟢 Strong | [Date] | [Action] |

## When to Update Your Stakeholder Map

**Quarterly Review (Recommended):**
- Reassess power and interest levels
- Update stakeholder positions (people move quadrants!)
- Adjust engagement strategies accordingly

**Ad-Hoc Updates (As Needed):**
- New executive joins organization
- Organization restructuring
- Major program milestone (success or challenge)
- Significant stakeholder feedback (positive or negative)
- Budget cycle planning
- Annual performance reviews

---

## Integration with Other BISO Tools

**Use this stakeholder map with:**

1. **Trust Equation Scorecard** → Measure relationship quality with "Manage Closely" stakeholders
2. **Monthly Pulse Survey** → Gather feedback from "Manage Closely" and "Keep Informed" groups
3. **Communication Calendar** → Schedule touchpoints based on quadrant strategy
4. **Escalation Framework** → Know who to escalate to (power dimension)
5. **Success Metrics** → Track stakeholder satisfaction by quadrant

---

## Tips for Success

**✅ DO:**
- Update quarterly or when landscape changes
- Share with your BISO team for coordinated engagement
- Use as input for communication planning
- Track relationship status changes over time
- Celebrate movement of stakeholders to "Manage Closely" (growing interest!)

**❌ DON'T:**
- Create once and forget (it gets stale quickly)
- Share stakeholder map outside BISO team (internal tool only)
- Ignore "Monitor" stakeholders completely (they can move quadrants)
- Over-engage "Monitor" group (wastes their time and yours)
- Treat as static (power and interest change frequently)

---

## Quick Reference Card

| Quadrant | Power | Interest | Strategy | Frequency | Risk Level |
|----------|-------|----------|----------|-----------|------------|
| **Manage Closely** | High | High | Key partners, deep engagement | Weekly | 🔴 High |
| **Keep Satisfied** | High | Low | Keep informed, don't overwhelm | Monthly | 🟡 Medium |
| **Keep Informed** | Low | High | Detailed updates, leverage enthusiasm | Bi-weekly | 🟢 Low |
| **Monitor** | Low | Low | Minimal effort, watch for changes | Quarterly | ⚪ Minimal |
