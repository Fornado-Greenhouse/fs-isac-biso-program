# Trust Equation Scorecard Template

**Purpose:** Quarterly relationship health assessment with key business stakeholders
**Time to Complete:** 15 minutes (self-assessment) + 30 minutes (stakeholder discussion)
**Frequency:** Quarterly with each Tier 1 stakeholder
**Primary Use:** Measure and improve trusted advisor relationships

---

## What is the Trust Equation?

The Trust Equation is your primary success metric as a BISO. It measures relationship health better than any technical security metric.

**Formula:**
```
Trust Score = (Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy) - Self-Orientation
```

**Target:** >2.5/5.0 with key stakeholders = Trusted advisor status

---

## The Four Components

### 1. Credibility (Expertise & Competence)
- **What it measures:** Do they believe you know what you're talking about?
- **Indicators:** Security knowledge depth, business understanding, sound judgment

### 2. Reliability (Consistency & Follow-Through)
- **What it measures:** Do you do what you say you'll do?
- **Indicators:** Keeps commitments, consistent availability, timely responses

### 3. Intimacy (Safety & Trust)
- **What it measures:** Do they feel safe sharing problems with you?
- **Indicators:** Psychologically safe, empathy, personal connection

### 4. Self-Orientation (Focus on Others vs. Self)
- **What it measures:** Are you serving them or serving yourself?
- **Indicators:** Pushes own agenda, takes vs. gives credit, own convenience
- **Important:** This is SUBTRACTED from the total

## How to Use This Scorecard

### Step 1: Self-Assess (15 minutes, done alone)
- Rate yourself honestly on each component
- Think of specific examples for each rating
- Calculate your preliminary score
- Identify areas where you think you're weakest

### Step 2: Schedule Discussion (30 minutes with stakeholder)
**Email template:**
```
Subject: Quarterly Partnership Check-In (30 minutes)

Hi [Name],

I'd like to schedule a 30-minute quarterly check-in to make sure
our security partnership is working well for you.

I use a simple framework to assess relationship health and identify
areas where I can better support your team. Would you have 30 minutes
in the next two weeks?

Thanks,
[Your name]
```

### Step 3: Discuss Openly (30-minute conversation)
1. **Start with context (2 min):** "I want to make sure I'm serving you well. I've done a self-assessment, and I'd like your perspective."
2. **Share your self-assessment (5 min):** Walk through your scores and examples
3. **Ask for their perspective (15 min):** "Where do you see this differently? What am I missing?"
4. **Create action plan (8 min):** "Based on this, what should I improve? What would make this partnership more valuable for you?"

### Step 4: Create Action Plan
Document 2-3 specific actions to improve:

| Component | Current Score | Target | Action | By When |
|-----------|--------------|--------|--------|---------|
| Example: Reliability | 3.0 | 4.0 | Respond to emails within 4 hours | Ongoing |
| Example: Intimacy | 2.5 | 3.5 | Schedule monthly coffee chats | Next month |

### Step 5: Track Progress Quarterly
Maintain a simple tracking log:

| Quarter | Stakeholder | Credibility | Reliability | Intimacy | Self-Orient | Total | Status | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------|-------------|-------|--------|-------|
| Q1 2025 | VP Retail   | 4           | 3           | 3        | 2           | 2.7   | 🟡     | Need better follow-up |
| Q2 2025 | VP Retail   | 4           | 4           | 4        | 1           | 3.7   | 🟢     | Much improved |

## Interpreting Your Scores

### 🟢 Score >2.5: Trusted Advisor Status
**What this means:** The relationship is working. They trust your advice and see you as a partner, not a gatekeeper.

**What to do:**
- Maintain current approach
- Continue quarterly check-ins
- Look for opportunities to deepen partnership
- Share what's working with other BISOs

### 🟡 Score 2.0-2.5: Building Trust
**What this means:** Foundation is solid, but not yet at trusted advisor level. Keep investing.

**What to do:**
- Focus on the lowest-scoring component
- Increase engagement frequency (monthly vs. quarterly)
- Ask explicitly: "What would make this partnership more valuable?"
- Check in again in 6-8 weeks (don't wait full quarter)

### 🔴 Score <2.0: Relationship Crisis
**What this means:** Something is broken. This requires immediate attention.

**What to do:**
1. **Within 48 hours:** Schedule candid 1-on-1 conversation
2. **Ask directly:** "I sense our partnership isn't working. What's going wrong from your perspective?"
3. **Listen without defending:** Understand their frustration
4. **Create recovery plan:** Specific actions, specific timelines
5. **Check in weekly:** Don't disappear after the conversation
6. **Escalate if needed:** If relationship can't be repaired, engage CISO for support

## Common Patterns & Fixes

### Pattern: High Credibility, Low Intimacy
**Diagnosis:** You're technically competent but feel distant or unapproachable.

**Fix:**
- Schedule informal coffee chats (no agenda)
- Share appropriate personal stories
- Ask about their challenges beyond security
- Respond to "how are you?" with honesty, not just "fine"

### Pattern: High Reliability, High Self-Orientation
**Diagnosis:** You deliver consistently but seem focused on your agenda, not theirs.

**Fix:**
- Start meetings with "What's on your mind?" not your agenda
- Give credit to stakeholders publicly
- Frame recommendations as "for your success" not "for security"
- Flexible on your convenience (meet them where they are)

### Pattern: Inconsistent scores across components
**Diagnosis:** You're strong in some areas but weak in others.

**Fix:**
- Focus on the lowest-scoring component first
- Don't try to fix everything at once
- Small, consistent improvements beat big sporadic efforts

---

## Best Practices

### Do This:
✅ Self-assess BEFORE talking to stakeholder
✅ Bring specific examples to the conversation
✅ Ask open-ended questions ("What could I improve?")
✅ Create action plans with dates
✅ Follow up on action plans
✅ Track trends over time (more important than absolute scores)

### Don't Do This:
❌ Skip the self-assessment step
❌ Get defensive about low scores
❌ Make excuses ("I was too busy...")
❌ Skip action planning
❌ Forget to follow up
❌ Only measure once and never again

---

## Frequency Guide

**Tier 1 Stakeholders** (High Power, High Interest):
- Measure quarterly
- Discuss scores in person
- Track trends rigorously
- Target: >2.5 minimum, aim for >3.0

**Tier 2 Stakeholders** (Keep Informed):
- Measure semi-annually
- Can discuss via email if needed
- Track trends casually
- Target: >2.0 minimum

**Tier 3 Stakeholders** (Monitor Minimally):
- Measure annually or as-needed
- Brief check-in sufficient
- Target: >2.0

---

## Next Steps

### For New BISOs (Month 1):
1. **Week 1:** Identify your 5-10 key stakeholders (Tier 1)
2. **Week 2:** Self-assess Trust Equation for each stakeholder
3. **Week 3-4:** Schedule and conduct first discussions
4. **End of Month 1:** Baseline scores established

### For Existing Programs:
1. **This week:** Self-assess all current Tier 1 stakeholders
2. **This month:** Conduct quarterly discussions
3. **Ongoing:** Maintain quarterly rhythm
4. **Red flags:** Address any <2.0 scores within 48 hours

---

## Key Takeaway

Trust Equation >2.5 with 5+ key stakeholders predicts BISO program success better than any technical security metric. Measure it quarterly, discuss it openly, act on the results.

Low trust scores are not failures — they're early warnings. Use them to fix relationships before they break.
