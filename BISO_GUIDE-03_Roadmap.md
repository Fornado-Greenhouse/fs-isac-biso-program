## Implementation Strategies

### Parallel Work Streams

**Stream 1: Foundation**
- Charter → Problem → Alignment
- Critical path, no delays
- Executive engagement essential

**Stream 2: Structure**
- Authority → Reporting → Jobs
- Can begin planning in Phase 1
- Recruitment can start early

**Stream 3: Operations**
- Processes → Support → Risk
- Requires structure first
- Tool selection parallel

**Stream 4: Strategy**
- Business Case → Executive → Strategic
- Needs operational data
- Value demonstration critical

### Resource Optimization

**Document Development Team**:
- 2-3 writers can manage parallel streams
- Subject matter experts for each area
- Review cycles built into timeline
- Executive review gates defined

**Stakeholder Engagement**:
- Group reviews where possible
- Standing committee meetings
- Consolidated approval cycles
- Efficient feedback integration

### Risk Mitigation

**Common Risks**:
1. **Executive attention loss**: Regular value updates
2. **Resource constraints**: Phased implementation
3. **Stakeholder fatigue**: Consolidated engagement
4. **Scope creep**: Clear boundaries
5. **Timeline pressure**: Built-in buffers
