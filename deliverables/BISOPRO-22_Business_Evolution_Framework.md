# BISO Business Evolution Framework (BISOPRO-22)
**Implementation Phase**: 4 (Months 13-15)

## Executive Summary

This framework establishes a systematic approach for BISO programs to continuously evolve and adapt alongside business transformation, ensuring sustained relevance and value delivery as organizations change. Drawing from the foundational strategies established in our [Strategic Alignment](./BISOPRO-15_Strategic_Alignment.md) and building upon the continuous improvement approaches outlined in our [Professional Development Framework](./BISOPRO-20_Professional_Development_Framework.md), this framework enables proactive adaptation to business evolution while maintaining the program excellence demonstrated through our [Challenge Mitigation Framework](./BISOPRO-21_Challenge_Mitigation_Framework.md). The framework directly supports the organizational evolution requirements defined in our [Charter](./BISOPRO-01_Charter.md) and addresses the adaptability challenges identified in our [Problem Statement](./BISOPRO-02_Problem_Statement.md).
