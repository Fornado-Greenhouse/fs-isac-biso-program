# BISO Alignment Model Analysis and Recommendation
**Implementation Phase**: 1 (Months 1-3)  
**Document Type**: Organizational Design

## 🎯 **Executive Summary & Recommendation**

**RECOMMENDED MODEL**: **Functional-Primary Hybrid** - combining functional business unit alignment with product specialization overlay.

This analysis evaluates four primary BISO alignment models to determine the optimal organizational structure for maximizing business-security integration while maintaining operational efficiency. The recommended hybrid model combines functional and product alignment to provide comprehensive coverage while optimizing resource utilization, supporting the objectives defined in our [BISO Charter](./BISOPRO-01_Charter.md) and addressing the challenges identified in our [Problem Statement](./BISOPRO-02_Problem_Statement.md).

### **Quick Decision Summary**
- **Primary Structure**: 4 Functional BISOs aligned to business units (Consumer/Retail, Commercial/Corporate, Investment Services, Corporate Functions)
- **Secondary Layer**: 3-4 Product Specialists (Cloud Security, Data Protection, Third-Party Risk, Emerging Tech)
- **Total Team**: 7-8 BISO professionals
- **Implementation**: 12 months to full deployment
- **Expected Benefits**: 35% improvement in security-business alignment, 40% reduction in security review cycle time
