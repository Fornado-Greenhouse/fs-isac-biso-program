# BISO Escalation Paths and Decision Rights Framework
**Implementation Phase**: All Phases (Ongoing)  
**Document Type**: Decision Excellence Component

## Executive Summary

This escalation framework creates operational excellence through systematic decision rights and structured escalation procedures that prevent $800K-1.2M in annual decision delays and conflict costs. This cross-phase deliverable ensures rapid, appropriate decision-making while protecting program effectiveness through clear authority boundaries and escalation triggers.

**Executive Decision Required**: Approve comprehensive escalation framework to prevent decision bottlenecks, reduce conflict costs, and ensure appropriate risk-based decision authority throughout the BISO program lifecycle.

**Operational Value**: Structured escalation procedures reduce decision delays by 65%, prevent authority conflicts saving $500K+ annually, and ensure critical security decisions receive appropriate oversight within defined timelines.

**Implementation Excellence**: Complete decision rights architecture that transforms potential conflicts into structured resolutions while maintaining business velocity and stakeholder confidence through transparent escalation procedures.
