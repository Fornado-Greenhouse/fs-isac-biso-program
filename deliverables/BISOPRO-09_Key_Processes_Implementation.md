  - Assess stakeholder security maturity and needs
- **Output**: Stakeholder engagement plan and relationship matrix
- **Success Criteria**: 100% of business unit key stakeholders identified and engaged

**1.2 Relationship Establishment**
- **Input**: Stakeholder engagement plan
- **Activities**:
  - Conduct introductory meetings with business leaders
  - Establish regular communication cadence
  - Define mutual expectations and service delivery agreements
- **Output**: Established stakeholder relationships and communication schedules
- **Success Criteria**: >4.0/5.0 stakeholder satisfaction with initial engagement

**1.3 Ongoing Partnership Maintenance**

  - Regular check-ins and business alignment discussions
  - Proactive communication of security implications for business initiatives
  - Continuous feedback collection and relationship optimization
- **Output**: Sustained stakeholder trust and partnership effectiveness
- **Success Criteria**: Quarterly stakeholder satisfaction >4.0/5.0 and 80%+ early security engagement

**1.4 Practical Data Collection for BISOPRO-05 Metrics**
- **Input**: Partnership activities and stakeholder interactions
- **Realistic Data Collection Approaches**:
  - **Simple Quarterly Check-ins**: Add 3-4 satisfaction questions to END of existing stakeholder meetings
    - "On a scale of 1-5, how satisfied are you with BISO support this quarter?"
    - "Did security help or hinder your business objectives this quarter?"
    - Document responses in simple spreadsheet or email notes
  - **Annual Informal Assessment**: During existing annual business reviews, ask about security value perception
    - "Looking back, did security enable any business outcomes this year?"
    - "What could security do differently to be more helpful?"
    - No formal survey - just capture feedback during normal business interactions
  - **Manual Relationship Tracking**: Monthly BISO team notes on stakeholder relationship health
    - Simple 1-5 scoring based on interaction quality and business unit feedback
    - Track in basic spreadsheet with quarterly trend review
  - **Opportunistic Feedback Collection**: Document positive/negative feedback when it naturally occurs
    - Capture when stakeholders mention security value (or lack thereof) in normal conversations
    - No systematic surveying - just awareness and documentation of organic feedback
- **Integration with BISOPRO-05 Metrics**:
  - Feeds Tier 3 BISO Service Satisfaction with available data (realistic baseline rather than comprehensive coverage)
  - Supports Security Perceived Value with anecdotal evidence and annual assessment
  - Enables Leadership Trust measurement through existing executive interactions
- **Data Flow**: Manual notes → Simple spreadsheet → Annual BISOPRO-05 summary report
- **Success Criteria**: Quarterly feedback from 60%+ of key stakeholders through existing meeting structures

**1.5 Practical ROI Tracking for Business Partnership**
- **Input**: Partnership activities, time investments, and business feedback
- **Simple ROI Documentation**:
  - **Time Investment Tracking**: Log hours spent on stakeholder relationship activities
    - Monthly log of BISO time spent on partnership development and maintenance
    - Simple categorization: meetings, communications, relationship building, problem solving
  - **Business Value Capture**: Document when partnerships deliver business value
    - Record instances where stakeholder relationships enabled business outcomes
    - Simple notes: "Relationship with Finance enabled faster compliance review" or "Partnership with Operations prevented security delay"
    - Annual compilation of partnership value stories with rough business impact estimates
  - **Cost Avoidance Documentation**: Track when relationships prevent problems
    - Document instances where stakeholder relationships prevented business friction
    - Estimate time/cost saved through proactive relationship management
    - Example: "Early engagement with Marketing prevented 2-week security review delay"
- **Annual ROI Estimate**: Partnership investment vs. documented business value
- **Success Criteria**: Annual documentation showing 2:1+ value ratio (business value vs. BISO time investment)
