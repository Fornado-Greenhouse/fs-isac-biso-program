# BISO Risk Assessment Methodology
**Implementation Phase**: 3 (Months 7-12)

## Executive Summary

**🎯 Methodology Purpose**: Establish systematic, business-aligned risk assessment methodology that transforms inconsistent ad hoc risk evaluation into standardized, repeatable process enabling confident business decision-making.

**🏗️ Framework Foundation**: This Phase 3 deliverable integrates cybersecurity risk assessment with business impact analysis, enabling consistent risk evaluation across business units while maintaining flexibility for unit-specific requirements per our [Charter](./BISOPRO-01_Charter.md#key-accountabilities).

**📊 Systematic Approach**: 4-phase methodology (Business Context → Risk Analysis → Evaluation → Treatment Planning) ensures comprehensive risk assessment with standardized deliverables, stakeholder communication, and quality assurance.

**✅ Executive Decision Required**: Approve systematic risk assessment methodology deployment with structured training, standardized tools, and quality assurance processes to enable consistent risk-informed business decisions.

**📈 Strategic Impact**: Addresses inconsistent risk management challenges identified in [Problem Statement](./BISOPRO-02_Problem_Statement.md#inconsistent-risk-management) through systematic methodology that supports authority structure per [Authority Framework](./BISOPRO-06_Authority_Framework.md) and enables strategic risk-informed decision making per [Strategic Alignment](./BISOPRO-15_Strategic_Alignment.md#risk-informed-decision-making).

**🎯 Business Outcomes**: Consistent risk evaluation, improved audit outcomes, enhanced regulatory confidence, and systematic business-security risk integration across all organizational initiatives.
