# BISO Security Consultation Framework
**Implementation Phase**: 3 (Months 7-12)  
**Document Type**: Service Delivery Framework Component

## Executive Summary
This security consultation framework component of the BISO program establishes systematic advisory services that transform reactive security engagement into proactive business partnership, ensuring consistent, high-quality advisory support across all business units as defined in our [Charter](./BISOPRO-01_Charter.md#key-accountabilities). This Phase 3 deliverable (Months 7-12) implements the advisory services outlined in our [Key Processes Implementation](./BISOPRO-09_Key_Processes_Implementation.md#core-process-2-project-security-integration) and directly addresses the consultation challenges identified in our [Problem Statement](./BISOPRO-02_Problem_Statement.md#reactive-security-engagement). The framework defines service types, delivery methodologies, and quality standards to maximize business value while maintaining security effectiveness per our [Success Metrics](./BISOPRO-05_Success_Metrics.md).

**Critical Executive Decisions Required**:
1. **Service Portfolio Authorization**: Approve comprehensive consultation services spanning strategic, project, and operational advisory support
2. **Response Time Standards**: Authorize service level commitments from same-day critical response to 10-day educational support
3. **Business Unit SME Commitment**: Approve significant subject matter expert time allocation (600-1,200 hours annually across business units)
4. **Quality Framework**: Approve performance standards targeting >4.5/5.0 stakeholder satisfaction and >80% recommendation adoption
5. **Consultation Authority**: Confirm BISO authority to provide advisory services with business unit cooperation requirements

**Implementation Reality**: Success depends primarily on business unit commitment to provide subject matter expert time and engagement rather than technology investments. This is an organizational capability enhancement requiring cultural change.

**Strategic Value**: Professional consultation framework positions BISOs as trusted business advisors enabling innovation while maintaining security effectiveness through structured advisory processes.
