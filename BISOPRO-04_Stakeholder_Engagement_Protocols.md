## Executive Summary
This document establishes comprehensive stakeholder engagement protocols for BISO operations, ensuring consistent, effective, and value-driven interactions with all stakeholder groups. The protocols define [engagement strategies](#engagement-strategy-framework), [communication standards](#communication-protocols-and-standards), and [relationship management approaches](#relationship-management-framework) that build trust, deliver value, and support business objectives. These protocols implement the stakeholder relationship requirements defined in our [Charter](./BISOPRO-01_Charter.md#stakeholder-relationship-management) and directly address the communication barriers identified in our [Problem Statement](./BISOPRO-02_Problem_Statement.md#communication-and-translation-barriers). The protocols support the business partnership processes outlined in our [Key Processes Implementation](./BISOPRO-09_Key_Processes_Implementation.md#business-partnership-and-engagement) and enable the executive engagement strategy detailed in our [Executive Sponsorship Plan](./BISOPRO-14_Executive_Sponsorship_Plan.md).
