# BISO Stakeholder Engagement Protocols

## Executive Summary
This document establishes comprehensive stakeholder engagement protocols for BISO operations, ensuring consistent, effective, and value-driven interactions with all stakeholder groups. The protocols define engagement strategies, communication standards, and relationship management approaches that build trust, deliver value, and support business objectives. These protocols implement the stakeholder relationship requirements defined in our [Charter](./BISOPRO-01_Charter.md#stakeholder-relationship-management) and directly address the communication barriers identified in our [Problem Statement](./BISOPRO-02_Problem_Statement.md#communication-and-translation-barriers).
