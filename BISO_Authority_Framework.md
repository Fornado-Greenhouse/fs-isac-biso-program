# BISO Authority Framework: "Mini CISO" Model

## Overview
This framework establishes the BISO as a "mini CISO" with delegated authority to make security decisions within their business unit scope, ensuring effective security leadership while maintaining appropriate oversight and escalation procedures.

## Authority Philosophy

### "Mini CISO" Concept
The BISO operates as a business unit-focused version of the CISO, with:
- **Scope**: Limited to assigned business unit(s)
- **Authority**: Delegated decision-making power within defined parameters
- **Accountability**: Full responsibility for business unit security outcomes
- **Independence**: Autonomous operation within established frameworks
- **Escalation**: Clear paths for decisions outside authority scope

### Delegation Principles
1. **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined scope of authority and limitations
2. **Risk-Based**: Authority levels aligned with risk impact
3. **Business Aligned**: Decisions consider business context and needs
4. **Accountable**: Clear accountability for decisions and outcomes
5. **Supported**: Adequate resources and backing for effective decision-making

## Authority Levels
