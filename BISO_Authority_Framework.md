# BISO Authority Framework: "Mini CISO" Model

## Overview
This framework establishes the BISO as a "mini CISO" with delegated authority to make security decisions within their business unit scope, ensuring effective security leadership while maintaining appropriate oversight and escalation procedures. This framework implements the authority structure defined in our [Charter](./BISO_Charter.md#authority-and-decision-rights) and directly addresses the decision-making challenges identified in our [Problem Statement](./BISO_Problem_Statement.md#inconsistent-risk-management). The framework supports the operational processes outlined in our [Key Processes Implementation](./BISO_Key_Processes_Implementation.md) and aligns with the independence requirements specified in our [Independence Framework](./BISO_Independence_Framework.md).

## Authority Philosophy

### "Mini CISO" Concept
The BISO operates as a business unit-focused version of the CISO, with:
- **Scope**: Limited to assigned business unit(s) per [Alignment Model](./BISO_Alignment_Model_Analysis.md#business-unit-alignment)
- **Authority**: Delegated decision-making power within defined parameters per [Charter](./BISO_Charter.md#decision-rights)
- **Accountability**: Full responsibility for business unit security outcomes per [Success Metrics](./BISO_Success_Metrics.md#accountability-metrics)
- **Independence**: Autonomous operation within established frameworks per [Independence Framework](./BISO_Independence_Framework.md)
- **Escalation**: Clear paths for decisions outside authority scope per [Escalation Decision Framework](./BISO_Escalation_Decision_Framework.md)

### Delegation Principles
1. **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined scope of authority and limitations per [Charter](./BISO_Charter.md#authority-and-decision-rights)
2. **Risk-Based**: Authority levels aligned with risk impact per [Risk Assessment Methodology](./BISO_Risk_Assessment_Methodology.md#risk-based-authority)
3. **Business Aligned**: Decisions consider business context and needs per [Strategic Alignment](./BISO_Strategic_Alignment.md#business-strategy-alignment)
4. **Accountable**: Clear accountability for decisions and outcomes per [Success Metrics](./BISO_Success_Metrics.md#performance-accountability)
5. **Supported**: Adequate resources and backing for effective decision-making per [Support Structure](./BISO_Support_Structure.md#authority-support-systems)
