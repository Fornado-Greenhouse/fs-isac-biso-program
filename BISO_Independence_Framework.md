# BISO Independence Framework

## Executive Summary
This framework ensures BISO independence from technology ownership and operational conflicts of interest, enabling objective security assessments and recommendations while maintaining strong collaborative relationships with technology and business teams.

## Independence Philosophy

### Core Independence Principles
1. **Objective Assessment**: BISOs must be able to assess security risks without conflicts of interest
2. **Independent Recommendations**: Security recommendations based on risk, not operational convenience
3. **Unbiased Evaluation**: Technology and vendor assessments free from ownership bias
4. **Professional Integrity**: Decisions guided by security expertise and organizational best interests
5. **Stakeholder Trust**: Independence builds trust with all stakeholders

### Benefits of Independence
- **Credible Risk Assessments**: Stakeholders trust independent security evaluations
- **Objective Recommendations**: Solutions chosen based on merit, not convenience
- **Audit Confidence**: Independent reviews satisfy auditor and regulator requirements
- **Vendor Neutrality**: Technology choices based on business needs and security effectiveness
- **Professional Growth**: BISOs develop broad expertise without technology ownership constraints

## Technology Ownership Separation
