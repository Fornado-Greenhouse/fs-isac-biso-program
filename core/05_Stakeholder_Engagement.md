# BISO Stakeholder Engagement

**What This Is:** Practical guidance for building trust and managing stakeholder relationships
**Who This Is For:** BISOs, program managers, anyone managing business-security relationships
**Time to Read:** 20 minutes
**What You'll Get:** Trust Equation framework, stakeholder mapping tools, engagement strategies

---

## Why Relationships Matter More Than You Think

**The Truth:**
BISO success is **60% relationships, 40% technical expertise**. You can have the best security recommendations in the world, but if stakeholders don't trust you, they won't follow your advice.

**The Evidence:**
FS-ISAC whitepaper emphasizes: *"There are no industry-wide metrics specific to the BISO role"* — meaning you can't measure BISO success purely by security metrics. **Trust and relationship quality are the primary indicators.**

**The Challenge:**
Most security professionals are trained in technical skills, not relationship management. This document teaches the relationship skills that make BISOs effective.

## The Trust Equation (Your Primary Metric)

### The Formula

```
              Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy
Trust  =  ───────────────────────────────────────
                  Self-Orientation
```

**Simplified:**
- **Credibility:** Do they believe you know your stuff?
- **Reliability:** Do you do what you say you'll do?
- **Intimacy:** Do they feel safe being candid with you?
- **Self-Orientation:** Do you focus on their needs or yours?

**Scoring:** Each component rated 1-5, formula gives score of 0-15 (normalized to 0-5.0)

**Targets:**
- 🔴 **Below 2.0:** Crisis — stakeholder doesn't trust you
- 🟡 **2.0-2.5:** Building — trust developing, keep working
- 🟢 **Above 2.5:** Healthy — trusted advisor status achieved

---

### Component 1: Credibility (Do They Trust Your Expertise?)

**What It Means:**
Stakeholders believe you have the security knowledge and business understanding to advise them well.

**How to Build Credibility:**

✅ **Demonstrate security expertise**
- Answer technical questions confidently
- Explain security concepts clearly
- Stay current on threats and trends
- Share industry insights and best practices

✅ **Show business understanding**
- Ask about business goals before recommending security
- Speak in business terms (revenue, time-to-market, customer impact)
- Understand their industry and competitive landscape
- Connect security decisions to business outcomes

✅ **Admit what you don't know**
- Say "I don't know, let me find out" instead of guessing
- Bring in specialists when needed
- Learn from mistakes publicly
- Show intellectual honesty

**Red Flags that Hurt Credibility:**
❌ Overpromising and underdelivering
❌ Giving advice outside your expertise
❌ Using jargon without explanation
❌ Dismissing business concerns as "not security"

---

### Component 2: Reliability (Do You Do What You Say?)

**What It Means:**
Stakeholders can count on you to follow through, meet deadlines, and keep commitments.

**How to Build Reliability:**

✅ **Keep commitments**
- If you say you'll review something by Friday, deliver by Friday
- Set realistic timelines, not optimistic ones
- Communicate early if you'll miss a deadline
- Track your commitments (use a system)

✅ **Be consistently available**
- Respond to messages within 24 hours (or set expectations)
- Attend scheduled meetings
- Show up when you say you will
- Be present and engaged when meeting

✅ **Follow established processes**
- Use agreed-upon communication channels
- Follow meeting agendas and time limits
- Document decisions and action items
- Close loops on open issues

**Red Flags that Hurt Reliability:**
❌ Ghosting on emails or requests
❌ Showing up late or unprepared
❌ Changing recommendations without explanation
❌ Forgetting previous commitments

---

### Component 3: Intimacy (Do They Feel Safe Being Candid?)

**What It Means:**
Stakeholders feel comfortable sharing problems, admitting mistakes, and raising concerns with you.

**How to Build Intimacy:**

✅ **Create psychological safety**
- Respond non-judgmentally to bad news
- Thank people for raising concerns early
- Separate "learning moments" from "performance issues"
- Make it safe to say "I don't understand"

✅ **Show empathy and understanding**
- Acknowledge business pressures they face
- Validate their concerns before offering solutions
- Show you understand their constraints
- Remember personal details (birthdays, family, interests)

✅ **Be authentic and vulnerable**
- Share your own challenges and mistakes
- Admit when security has been a blocker
- Show your human side
- Build personal connection, not just professional

**Red Flags that Hurt Intimacy:**
❌ Lecturing stakeholders about security basics
❌ Making people feel stupid for not knowing security
❌ Using security issues as "gotcha" moments
❌ Maintaining distant, purely professional relationship

---

### Component 4: Self-Orientation (Are You Focused on Them or You?)

**What It Means:**
The degree to which you focus on stakeholder needs vs. your own agenda. **This component REDUCES trust** — lower is better.

**Low Self-Orientation (Good):**

✅ **Focus on their success**
- Ask "How can I help you achieve your goals?"
- Customize security advice to their situation
- Celebrate their wins, not just security compliance
- Measure success by business outcomes, not security metrics

✅ **Adapt to their preferences**
- Use their communication style and channels
- Work on their timeline when possible
- Meet them where they are (their office, their meetings)
- Respect their time and priorities

✅ **Give credit generously**
- Acknowledge business unit's security efforts publicly
- Share credit for security wins
- Highlight team accomplishments
- Make stakeholders look good to their leadership

**High Self-Orientation (Bad):**

❌ **Pushing security agenda regardless of business impact**
❌ **Taking credit for security improvements**
❌ **Making decisions for security convenience, not business benefit**
❌ **Prioritizing your goals over stakeholder needs**

## Common Relationship Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: "Security Always Says No"

**Symptoms:**
- Business leaders avoid engaging you early
- You hear about projects late or not at all
- Stakeholders describe you as "blocker" or "gatekeeper"
- Trust Equation score <2.0

**Root Cause:**
High self-orientation — prioritizing security convenience over business outcomes.

**Solution:**
- Change your language from "no" to "yes, if..."
- Offer 2-3 options at different risk/speed trade-offs
- Focus on enabling business, not preventing activity
- Say "how can we make this work?" not "this won't work"

**Example:**
❌ **Bad:** "We can't launch without penetration testing, that takes 3 weeks."
✅ **Good:** "Here are three options: (1) Launch in 4 weeks with pen test, (2) Launch now with enhanced monitoring and pen test after, or (3) Launch to limited users now, full launch after pen test. Which aligns with your business goals?"

---

### Challenge 2: Low Credibility with Technical Teams

**Symptoms:**
- Developers question your technical recommendations
- IT teams work around you instead of with you
- You're not invited to architecture discussions
- Trust Equation credibility score <3.0

**Root Cause:**
Insufficient technical depth or outdated knowledge.

**Solution:**
- Deep-dive technical learning in key areas (cloud, DevOps, modern app dev)
- Bring in security specialists for deep technical discussions
- Admit knowledge gaps and learn from technical teams
- Stay current with technology trends and best practices

**Example:**
✅ "I'm not an expert on Kubernetes security, so I've brought in [Cloud Security Specialist] to work with you on the container security architecture. I'll handle the business risk assessment while they dive deep technically."

---

### Challenge 3: Stakeholder Won't Make Time for Security

**Symptoms:**
- Meetings cancelled repeatedly
- Slow responses to security questions
- Last-minute requests for urgent reviews
- Difficulty getting on stakeholder's calendar

**Root Cause:**
Low intimacy (not feeling connected) or high self-orientation (you're not focused on their priorities).

**Solution:**
- Meet them where they are (their meetings, their location)
- Tie security to their goals (don't make it about security)
- Be flexible with timing and format
- Build personal relationship, not just professional
- Make engagement valuable for them (provide insights, not just requests)

**Example:**
✅ "I know you're focused on the Q3 product launch. Instead of a separate security meeting, can I attend your weekly product planning standup? I'll keep security updates to 5 minutes and can answer questions as they come up."

---

### Challenge 4: Stakeholder Sees You as "IT Security," Not Business Partner

**Symptoms:**
- Not invited to business planning meetings
- Treated as technical resource, not advisor
- Asked to "just tell us the requirements"
- Low credibility on business matters (score <3.0)

**Root Cause:**
Insufficient business acumen or too much technical focus in communications.

**Solution:**
- Learn the business model, revenue streams, competitive landscape
- Ask business questions before technical questions
- Speak in business language (P&L, time-to-market, customer satisfaction)
- Participate in business activities (not just security meetings)
- Demonstrate understanding of business pressures and priorities

**Example:**
✅ "I've been reviewing your business unit strategy and see you're focused on growing SMB market share 20% this year. Security can enable that by reducing friction in the onboarding process. Can we discuss how to balance speed-to-onboard with fraud risk?"

## Key Principles for Relationship Success

### 1. Trust Is Earned Through Actions, Not Words
Say less, do more. Keep small commitments to build credibility for big commitments.

### 2. Relationship Building Is Continuous, Not Event-Based
Weekly small touchpoints beat monthly big meetings. Consistency matters more than intensity.

### 3. Listening Beats Talking
Aim for 70% listening, 30% talking in stakeholder meetings. Understand before being understood.

### 4. Focus on Their Success, Not Your Security Goals
When stakeholders succeed, security succeeds. When security succeeds but business struggles, nobody wins.

### 5. Trust Equation Score >2.5 Predicts Success
If you're below 2.5 with key stakeholders, fix relationships before launching new security initiatives.

---

## Next Steps

### For New BISOs
1. **Week 1:** Complete stakeholder mapping using Power-Interest Matrix
2. **Week 2:** Measure baseline Trust Equation scores (self-assessment)
3. **Month 1:** Focus on intimacy and reliability (easier wins than credibility)
4. **Quarter 1:** Achieve >2.5 Trust Equation with at least 3 key stakeholders

### For Existing Programs
1. **Quarterly:** Measure Trust Equation scores with all Tier 1 stakeholders
2. **Monthly:** Review engagement frequency and quality
3. **Address <2.0 scores immediately** — these are red flags
4. **Celebrate >3.0 scores** — recognize relationship excellence

### For Program Leaders
1. **Hire for relationship skills** — these are harder to teach than technical skills
2. **Measure Trust Equation formally** — not just informal feedback
3. **Coach BISOs on low scores** — provide relationship skill development
4. **Recognize relationship builders** — not just technical experts

---

**Key Takeaway:**
BISO effectiveness is 60% relationships, 40% technical. Measure trust with the Trust Equation, prioritize stakeholders with Power-Interest Matrix, and focus on intimacy and low self-orientation to build trusted advisor status.
