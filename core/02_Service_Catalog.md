## What BISOs DON'T Do

Setting clear expectations:

❌ **Implement security controls** (they advise; security/IT teams implement)
❌ **Approve/deny business decisions** (they advise; business leaders decide)
❌ **Own security risk** (business units own risk; BISOs help manage)
❌ **Slow down business** (they enable faster movement with confidence)
❌ **Replace security teams** (they bridge business and security)
❌ **Conduct penetration testing** (specialized security teams handle)
❌ **Manage security incidents** (security operations leads; BISOs support business impact)
