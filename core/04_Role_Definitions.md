# BISO Role Definitions

**What This Is:** Clear definitions of BISO roles, qualifications, and career paths
**Who This Is For:** HR, recruiters, hiring managers, BISO candidates
**Time to Read:** 15 minutes
**What You'll Get:** Understanding of BISO job requirements and success profiles

## What Makes a Successful BISO

**The Challenge:**
BISOs need a rare combination of skills: deep security expertise **AND** business partnership capabilities **AND** stakeholder management excellence. Most security professionals have one or two of these, but not all three.

**The Profile:**
The best BISOs are:
- 🔐 **Security experts** who can assess risks and design controls
- 🤝 **Relationship builders** who earn trust and influence without authority
- 💼 **Business thinkers** who understand P&L, strategy, and operations
- 🗣️ **Communicators** who translate technical jargon into business language

**Not Your Typical Security Role:**
If someone excels at technical security but struggles with stakeholder relationships, they'll fail as a BISO. If they're great at relationships but lack security depth, they'll lose credibility. Both dimensions are critical.
