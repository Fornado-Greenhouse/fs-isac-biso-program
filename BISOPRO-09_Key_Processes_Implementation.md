**1.3 Ongoing Partnership Maintenance**
- **Input**: Established relationships and business unit priorities
- **Activities**:
  - Regular check-ins and business alignment discussions per [Strategic Alignment](./BISOPRO-15_Strategic_Alignment.md#quarterly-alignment-reviews)
  - Proactive communication of security implications for business initiatives per [Risk Assessment Methodology](./BISOPRO-12_Risk_Assessment_Methodology.md#business-impact-assessment)
  - Continuous feedback collection and relationship optimization per [Success Metrics](./BISOPRO-05_Success_Metrics.md#stakeholder-feedback-integration)
- **Output**: Sustained stakeholder trust and partnership effectiveness
- **Success Criteria**: Quarterly stakeholder satisfaction >4.0/5.0 and 80%+ early security engagement per [Success Metrics](./BISOPRO-05_Success_Metrics.md#proactive-risk-management)

**1.4 Practical Data Collection for BISOPRO-05 Metrics**
- **Input**: Partnership activities and stakeholder interactions
- **Realistic Data Collection Approaches**:
  - **Simple Quarterly Check-ins**: Add 3-4 satisfaction questions to END of existing stakeholder meetings per [Success Metrics](./BISOPRO-05_Success_Metrics.md#tier-3-stakeholder-satisfaction-metrics)
    - "On a scale of 1-5, how satisfied are you with BISO support this quarter?"
    - "Did security help or hinder your business objectives this quarter?"
    - Document responses in simple spreadsheet or email notes
  - **Annual Informal Assessment**: During existing annual business reviews, ask about security value perception
    - "Looking back, did security enable any business outcomes this year?"
    - "What could security do differently to be more helpful?"
    - No formal survey - just capture feedback during normal business interactions
  - **Manual Relationship Tracking**: Monthly BISO team notes on stakeholder relationship health
    - Simple 1-5 scoring based on interaction quality and business unit feedback
    - Track in basic spreadsheet with quarterly trend review
  - **Opportunistic Feedback Collection**: Document positive/negative feedback when it naturally occurs
    - Capture when stakeholders mention security value (or lack thereof) in normal conversations
    - No systematic surveying - just awareness and documentation of organic feedback
- **Integration with BISOPRO-05 Metrics**:
  - Feeds Tier 3 BISO Service Satisfaction with available data (realistic baseline rather than comprehensive coverage)
  - Supports Security Perceived Value with anecdotal evidence and annual assessment
  - Enables Leadership Trust measurement through existing executive interactions

    - Simple categorization: meetings, communications, relationship building, problem solving
  - **Business Value Capture**: Document when partnerships deliver business value
    - Record instances where stakeholder relationships enabled business outcomes
    - Simple notes: "Relationship with Finance enabled faster compliance review" or "Partnership with Operations prevented security delay"
    - Annual compilation of partnership value stories with rough business impact estimates
  - **Cost Avoidance Documentation**: Track when relationships prevent problems
    - Document instances where stakeholder relationships prevented business friction
    - Estimate time/cost saved through proactive relationship management
    - Example: "Early engagement with Marketing prevented 2-week security review delay"
- **Annual ROI Estimate**: Partnership investment vs. documented business value
- **Success Criteria**: Annual documentation showing 2:1+ value ratio (business value vs. BISO time investment)

- **Realistic Data Collection Approaches**:
  - **Manual Security Review Timing**: BISO tracks start/end dates of security reviews in simple log per [Success Metrics](./BISOPRO-05_Success_Metrics.md#tier-1-business-impact-metrics)
    - Email timestamp when security review request received and when completed
    - Weekly spreadsheet update with project name, start date, end date, duration
    - Target measurement: <5 days average (but measured manually, not automatically)
  - **Early Engagement Tracking**: BISO documents timing of involvement in projects
    - Note whether security was engaged during planning, development, or post-development
    - Simple categorization in project log: "Early" (planning), "Mid" (development), "Late" (post-dev)
    - Target measurement: >60% early engagement (reduced from 80% to be realistic)
  - **Rework Documentation**: Capture when projects require security changes after development
    - Document instances where security requirements caused development rework
    - Simple count and basic cost estimate when available (not comprehensive cost tracking)
    - Target measurement: Reduced rework instances year-over-year
  - **Review Completion Tracking**: Track whether security reviews are completed on schedule
    - Monitor whether BISO meets commitments to project teams
    - Simple on-time/late tracking in project log
