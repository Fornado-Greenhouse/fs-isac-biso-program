# BISO Escalation Paths and Decision Rights Framework

## Executive Summary
This framework establishes clear escalation paths and decision rights for BISOs, ensuring appropriate decision-making authority while providing structured escalation for complex situations, conflicts, and decisions beyond BISO authority.

## Decision Rights Architecture

### Decision Categories

**Category 1: Autonomous Decisions**
- Decisions BISO can make independently
- No approval required
- Documentation and notification standards apply
- Examples: Risk assessments, standard control implementations, policy interpretations

**Category 2: Consultative Decisions**
- BISO has decision authority after consultation
- Input from stakeholders required but not binding
- BISO maintains final decision responsibility
- Examples: Medium-risk exceptions, business process security changes

**Category 3: Collaborative Decisions**
- Joint decision-making with other stakeholders
- Consensus-building approach
- Shared accountability for outcomes
- Examples: Resource allocation, strategic planning

**Category 4: Escalated Decisions**
- Decisions requiring higher authority approval
- BISO provides recommendation and analysis
- Formal approval process required
- Examples: High-risk exceptions, major policy changes

## Escalation Trigger Framework

### Risk-Based Escalation Triggers

**Low Risk (No Escalation Required)**:
- Risk rating: 1-3 on 10-point scale
- Business impact: Minimal operational disruption
- Financial impact: <$50K potential loss
- Regulatory impact: No compliance implications
- BISO Authority: Autonomous decision

**Medium Risk (Consultation Required)**:
- Risk rating: 4-6 on 10-point scale
- Business impact: Moderate operational impact
- Financial impact: $50K-$500K potential loss
- Regulatory impact: Minor compliance considerations
- BISO Authority: Consultative decision

**High Risk (Approval Required)**:
- Risk rating: 7-8 on 10-point scale
- Business impact: Significant operational impact
- Financial impact: $500K-$5M potential loss
- Regulatory impact: Material compliance implications
- BISO Authority: Escalation required

**Critical Risk (Executive Escalation)**:
- Risk rating: 9-10 on 10-point scale
- Business impact: Severe operational disruption
- Financial impact: >$5M potential loss
- Regulatory impact: Major compliance violations
- BISO Authority: Executive decision required

### Situational Escalation Triggers

**Immediate Escalation (0-4 Hours)**:
- Active security incidents affecting business operations
- Critical system vulnerabilities with active exploitation
- Regulatory enforcement actions or notifications
- Executive leadership security concerns
- Media or public security issues

**Urgent Escalation (4-24 Hours)**:
- High-risk security findings requiring rapid response
- Business stakeholder conflicts affecting security posture
- Resource conflicts preventing security implementation
- Vendor security incidents affecting business operations
- Audit findings requiring immediate attention

**Priority Escalation (1-7 Days)**:
- Strategic security decisions affecting business direction
- Cross-business unit security coordination issues
- Resource requests exceeding BISO authority
- Policy interpretation disputes
- Long-term security architecture decisions

**Planned Escalation (Regular Schedule)**:
- Monthly operational reviews and status updates
- Quarterly strategic alignment assessments
- Annual program reviews and planning
- Budget and resource planning cycles
- Performance evaluation and goal setting

## Escalation Paths

### Security Risk Escalations

**Path 1: BISO → CISO**
- **When**: Security risks requiring organizational response
- **Timeline**: Based on risk level (immediate to 7 days)
- **Process**: Risk analysis, recommendation, formal escalation
- **Decision Authority**: CISO (with CEO/Board for critical issues)

**Path 2: BISO → Business Unit Leader**
- **When**: Business impact decisions requiring business input
- **Timeline**: Based on business urgency
- **Process**: Business impact analysis, stakeholder consultation
- **Decision Authority**: Business Unit Leader (with executive escalation for major impact)

**Path 3: BISO → CISO + Business Unit Leader (Joint)**
- **When**: Security decisions with significant business impact
- **Timeline**: Coordinated based on urgency and complexity
- **Process**: Joint analysis, collaborative decision-making
- **Decision Authority**: Joint decision or escalation to executives

**Path 4: BISO → Executive Leadership**
- **When**: Strategic decisions affecting organizational direction
- **Timeline**: Formal process with executive calendar coordination
- **Process**: Comprehensive analysis, executive briefing, formal decision
- **Decision Authority**: CEO, Board, or Executive Committee

### Stakeholder Conflict Escalations

**Level 1: Direct Resolution**
- **Participants**: BISO + Conflicting stakeholder(s)
- **Process**: Direct communication, problem-solving, negotiation
- **Timeline**: 1-3 business days
- **Documentation**: Informal resolution notes

**Level 2: Facilitated Resolution**
- **Participants**: BISO + Stakeholder + Neutral facilitator
- **Process**: Structured mediation, compromise development
- **Timeline**: 1 week
- **Documentation**: Formal resolution agreement

**Level 3: Management Resolution**
- **Participants**: BISO + CISO + Business Unit Leader
- **Process**: Management review, decision, implementation plan
- **Timeline**: 2 weeks
- **Documentation**: Management decision and rationale

**Level 4: Executive Resolution**
- **Participants**: Executive leadership team
- **Process**: Executive review, strategic decision, organizational communication
- **Timeline**: 1 month
- **Documentation**: Executive decision and implementation directive

### Resource and Authority Escalations

**Type 1: Budget and Resource Requests**
- **Escalation Path**: BISO → CISO → Business Unit Leader → Executive Leadership
- **Decision Points**: Resource availability, business priority, strategic alignment
- **Timeline**: Monthly budget cycles, quarterly planning, annual budget process

**Type 2: Authority Expansion Requests**
- **Escalation Path**: BISO → CISO → Executive Leadership
- **Decision Points**: Role maturity, organizational need, risk management
- **Timeline**: Quarterly role reviews, annual authority assessment

**Type 3: Cross-Business Unit Coordination**
- **Escalation Path**: BISO → CISO → Business Unit Leaders → Executive Leadership
- **Decision Points**: Business impact, resource requirements, strategic priorities
- **Timeline**: Based on business needs and strategic planning cycles
