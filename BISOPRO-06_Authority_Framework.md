## Overview
This framework establishes the BISO as a "mini CISO" with delegated authority to make security decisions within their business unit scope, ensuring effective security leadership while maintaining appropriate oversight and escalation procedures. This framework implements the authority structure defined in our [Charter](./BISOPRO-01_Charter.md#authority-and-decision-rights) and directly addresses the decision-making challenges identified in our [Problem Statement](./BISOPRO-02_Problem_Statement.md#inconsistent-risk-management). The framework supports the operational processes outlined in our [Key Processes Implementation](./BISOPRO-09_Key_Processes_Implementation.md) and aligns with the independence requirements specified in our [Independence Framework](./BISOPRO-18_Independence_Framework.md).

## Authority Philosophy

### "Mini CISO" Concept
The BISO operates as a business unit-focused version of the CISO, with:
- **Scope**: Limited to assigned business unit(s) per [Alignment Model](./BISOPRO-03_Alignment_Model_Analysis.md#business-unit-alignment)
- **Authority**: Delegated decision-making power within defined parameters per [Charter](./BISOPRO-01_Charter.md#decision-rights)
- **Accountability**: Full responsibility for business unit security outcomes per [Success Metrics](./BISOPRO-05_Success_Metrics.md#accountability-metrics)
- **Independence**: Autonomous operation within established frameworks per [Independence Framework](./BISOPRO-18_Independence_Framework.md)
- **Escalation**: Clear paths for decisions outside authority scope per [Escalation Decision Framework](./BISOPRO-25_Escalation_Decision_Framework.md)

### Delegation Principles
1. **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined scope of authority and limitations per [Charter](./BISOPRO-01_Charter.md#authority-and-decision-rights)
2. **Risk-Based**: Authority levels aligned with risk impact per [Risk Assessment Methodology](./BISOPRO-12_Risk_Assessment_Methodology.md#risk-based-authority)
3. **Business Aligned**: Decisions consider business context and needs per [Strategic Alignment](./BISOPRO-15_Strategic_Alignment.md#business-strategy-alignment)
4. **Accountable**: Clear accountability for decisions and outcomes per [Success Metrics](./BISOPRO-05_Success_Metrics.md#performance-accountability)
5. **Supported**: Adequate resources and backing for effective decision-making per [Support Structure](./BISOPRO-10_Support_Structure.md#authority-support-systems)

## Authority Levels

### Level 1: Autonomous Authority
**Description**: Decisions BISO can make independently without approval

**Risk Assessment and Management**:
- Conduct risk assessments for business unit systems and processes
- Assign risk ratings using organizational risk framework
- Recommend risk mitigation strategies
- Monitor risk remediation progress
- Report risk status to stakeholders

**Security Control Implementation**:
- Select and implement standard security controls
- Customize security controls for business unit needs
- Approve compensating controls for standard risks
- Monitor control effectiveness
- Update control configurations within guidelines

**Policy and Procedure Interpretation**:
- Interpret organizational security policies for business context
- Create business unit-specific security procedures
- Provide guidance on policy compliance
- Approve minor policy exceptions within defined parameters
- Document policy interpretation decisions

**Operational Security Decisions**:
- Security tool configuration for business unit
- Security monitoring and alerting customization
- User access reviews and approvals (standard access)
- Security training content customization
- Routine vendor security assessments

### Level 2: Consultative Authority
**Description**: Decisions requiring consultation but not formal approval

**Medium-Risk Exceptions**:
- Non-standard security control implementations per [Risk Assessment Methodology](./BISOPRO-12_Risk_Assessment_Methodology.md#exception-risk-assessment)
- Medium-risk policy exceptions per [Independence Framework](./BISOPRO-18_Independence_Framework.md#exception-management)
- Alternative compliance approaches per [Executive Briefing Framework](./BISOPRO-13_Executive_Briefing_Framework.md#compliance-alternatives)
- Resource allocation recommendations per [Business Case ROI](./BISOPRO-11_Business_Case_ROI.md#resource-optimization)
- Business unit security architecture changes per [Security Consultation Framework](./BISOPRO-17_Security_Consultation_Framework.md#architecture-changes)

**Stakeholder Engagement**:
- Business unit security strategy development per [Strategic Alignment](./BISOPRO-15_Strategic_Alignment.md#business-unit-strategy) coordinating with [Stakeholder Engagement Protocols](./BISOPRO-04_Stakeholder_Engagement_Protocols.md#business-unit-leadership-engagement)
- Security requirement definition for projects per [Key Processes Implementation](./BISOPRO-09_Key_Processes_Implementation.md#project-security-integration) and [Security Consultation Framework](./BISOPRO-17_Security_Consultation_Framework.md#requirement-definition)
- Vendor security requirement specification per [Stakeholder Engagement Protocols](./BISOPRO-04_Stakeholder_Engagement_Protocols.md#vendor-and-partner-engagement) and [Security Consultation Framework](./BISOPRO-17_Security_Consultation_Framework.md#vendor-assessment)
- Incident response coordination utilizing [Reporting Structure](./BISOPRO-07_Reporting_Structure.md#incident-reporting-procedures) and [Executive Briefing Framework](./BISOPRO-13_Executive_Briefing_Framework.md#incident-communication)
- Security awareness program design per [Training Development Programs](./BISOPRO-19_Training_Development_Programs.md#business-specific-training) and [Stakeholder Engagement Protocols](./BISOPRO-04_Stakeholder_Engagement_Protocols.md#training-coordination)

**Process**: 
- BISO develops recommendation
- Consults with CISO and/or business leadership
- BISO makes final decision with consultation input
- Documents decision rationale and consultation

### Level 3: Approval Authority
**Description**: Decisions requiring formal approval from CISO or business leadership

**High-Risk Decisions**:
- High-risk security exceptions
- Major security architecture changes
- Significant policy deviations
- Large resource requests
- Cross-business unit security decisions

**Strategic Decisions**:
- Business unit security strategy changes
- Major security investment recommendations
- Regulatory compliance approach changes
- Significant third-party security arrangements
- Enterprise-wide security impact decisions

**Process**:
- BISO prepares formal recommendation with risk analysis
- Submits to appropriate approver (CISO and/or business leader)
- Presents business case and risk assessment
- Receives formal approval or direction
- Documents approved decision and implementation plan
