# BISO Authority Framework: "Mini CISO" Model

## 🎯 **Authority at a Glance & Quick Start**

**Mission**: Establish BISOs as "mini CISOs" with delegated authority to make security decisions within business unit scope, enabling effective security leadership while maintaining appropriate oversight and escalation procedures.

### **Authority Framework at a Glance**
- **Authority Model**: 3-tier decision framework (Autonomous, Consultative, Approval) with risk-based delegation
- **Decision Scope**: Business unit security decisions from low-risk operations to medium-risk exceptions
- **Escalation Triggers**: High-risk decisions, cross-business impact, major architecture changes
- **Accountability**: Full responsibility for business unit security outcomes with quarterly performance reviews
- **Support Structure**: CISO backing, business sponsorship, formal delegation documentation

### **Key Authority Decisions**
- ✅ **Autonomous Authority**: Risk assessments, standard controls, policy interpretation, operational security (Level 1)
- ⚠️ **Consultative Authority**: Medium-risk exceptions, architecture changes, resource recommendations (Level 2) 
- 🔺 **Approval Required**: High-risk decisions, strategic changes, major investments (Level 3)
- 🚨 **Executive Escalation**: Critical risks, enterprise-wide impact, regulatory issues (Executive Level)

### **Implementation Success Targets**
- **Decision Efficiency**: 90% of decisions resolved at Level 1-2 without escalation
- **Authority Utilization**: 80%+ authority usage within defined scope boundaries  
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: >4.0/5.0 business unit satisfaction with BISO decision-making
- **Risk Management**: Effective risk outcomes with appropriate escalation discipline

## Overview
This framework establishes the BISO as a "mini CISO" with delegated authority to make security decisions within their business unit scope, ensuring effective security leadership while maintaining appropriate oversight and escalation procedures. This framework implements the authority structure defined in our [Charter](./BISOPRO-01_Charter.md#authority-and-decision-rights) and directly addresses the decision-making challenges identified in our [Problem Statement](./BISOPRO-02_Problem_Statement.md#inconsistent-risk-management). The framework supports the operational processes outlined in our [Key Processes Implementation](./BISOPRO-09_Key_Processes_Implementation.md) and aligns with the independence requirements specified in our [Independence Framework](./BISOPRO-18_Independence_Framework.md).

## Authority Philosophy

### "Mini CISO" Concept
The BISO operates as a business unit-focused version of the CISO, with:
- **Scope**: Limited to assigned business unit(s) per [Alignment Model](./BISOPRO-03_Alignment_Model_Analysis.md#business-unit-alignment)
- **Authority**: Delegated decision-making power within defined parameters per [Charter](./BISOPRO-01_Charter.md#decision-rights)
- **Accountability**: Full responsibility for business unit security outcomes per [Success Metrics](./BISOPRO-05_Success_Metrics.md#accountability-metrics)
- **Independence**: Autonomous operation within established frameworks per [Independence Framework](./BISOPRO-18_Independence_Framework.md)
- **Escalation**: Clear paths for decisions outside authority scope per [Escalation Decision Framework](./BISOPRO-25_Escalation_Decision_Framework.md)

### Delegation Principles
1. **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined scope of authority and limitations per [Charter](./BISOPRO-01_Charter.md#authority-and-decision-rights)
2. **Risk-Based**: Authority levels aligned with risk impact per [Risk Assessment Methodology](./BISOPRO-12_Risk_Assessment_Methodology.md#risk-based-authority)
3. **Business Aligned**: Decisions consider business context and needs per [Strategic Alignment](./BISOPRO-15_Strategic_Alignment.md#business-strategy-alignment)
4. **Accountable**: Clear accountability for decisions and outcomes per [Success Metrics](./BISOPRO-05_Success_Metrics.md#performance-accountability)
5. **Supported**: Adequate resources and backing for effective decision-making per [Support Structure](./BISOPRO-10_Support_Structure.md#authority-support-systems)
